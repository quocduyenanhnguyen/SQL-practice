# Software I used to write SQL queries: 
[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

# Description: 

- In this project (I did this project back in June, prior to experiencing with Tableau), I wrote several SQL queries to manipulate and transform data from the Restaurant and Library database. Because the database can only be opened in SQLiteStudio so I created new tables in MySQL Workbench and loaded the datasets into these new tables. The two databases can be found from here: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-code-challenges/sql-code-challenges?autoplay=true&u=2071660
